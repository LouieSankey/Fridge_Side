#Fridge-Side https://louiesankey.github.io/fridge-side/

Fridge-Side helps you find recipies that use ingredients you already have in your home and refigerator.

It let's you prioritize search results based on fewest missing ingredients, so you can find recipes where you only need to buy one or two more items, and it also lets you prioritize maximum ingredients used, so you can efficiently use up whatever leftovers you already have in your refigerator.

It also lets you compile a shopping list to keep track of missing ingredients across multiple recipes.

The app features a throwback design with an index card, polaroid photos, and note paper stuck to the side of a refrigerator with magnets.

Currently the app uses vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and jquery.

In the future, it will integrate with Twillio and let authenticated users SMS the shopping list to their smart phone.

#Leftovers
https://louiesankey.github.io/leftovers_app/

Leftovers helps you find recipies that use ingredients you already have in your home and refigerator. 

It let's you prioritize search results based on fewest missing ingredients, so you can find recipes where you only need to buy one or two more items, and it also lets you prioritize maximum ingredients used, so you can efficiently use up whatever leftovers you already have in your refigerator. 

It also lets you compile a shopping list to keep track of missing ingredients across multiple different recipes. 

The app uses html, css, javascript, and jquery.
